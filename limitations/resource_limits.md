# Resource limits

Monty enforces hard limits on memory, time, allocations, and recursion to
keep untrusted code bounded. When a limit is exceeded, execution
terminates with a `ResourceError` (visible to the *host*, not catchable
inside the sandbox).

## Memory / size limits

- Allocation tracking is global; the host sets the bytes budget when
  constructing the VM.
- The byte count is **approximate**: per-object sizing uses `py_estimate_size`,
  which elides bookkeeping overhead (HashMap bucket padding, `Vec` capacity
  slack, `SmallVec` inline buffers, scheduler queue allocations) and rounds
  per-spawn task overhead to a fixed conservative constant. The configured
  `max_memory` is a budget on user-visible data, not a hard ceiling on
  process RSS.
- Operations whose result is bounded by simple arithmetic on input sizes
  are **pre-checked** before allocating: integer multiplication, left
  shift, integer power, sequence repeat (`'x' * n`), padding (`str.ljust`,
  `str.center`, `str.zfill`, `bytes.ljust`, …), and f-string formatting
  (both dynamic width `f"{v:>{w}}"` and dynamic precision on float
  formats `f"{v:.{p}f}"` / `e` / `%`). The pre-check threshold is 100 KB —
  anything that would estimate above that is rejected with `ResourceError`
  rather than attempting the allocation.
- `bigint.pow(base, exp)` estimates result size as `bits(base) * exp` with
  a 4× safety multiplier to cover repeated-squaring intermediate values.

## Integer-specific caps

- `pow(base, exp)` / `base ** exp` with an exponent larger than `u32::MAX`
  (≈ 4.3 × 10⁹) raises `OverflowError: "exponent too large"`.
- `pow(base, exp, mod)` requires all integer arguments and rejects negative
  exponents (`ValueError`).
- `int(str_or_bytes, base)` rejects inputs over 4,300 digits before the
  potentially quadratic BigInt parse when the effective base is not a power
  of two. The fixed cap matches CPython's
  `sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits`.

## Recursion

- Python-level call depth is hardcoded at **1000 frames**. The 1001st
  nested call raises `RecursionError`.
- Production sandbox code cannot change the recursion limit. Test builds may
  expose `sys.setrecursionlimit()` as a lowering-only fixture hook; it cannot
  raise the host-configured ceiling.
- Async stacks count toward the limit but each `await` boundary is treated
  as one frame, so `await`-chains do not amplify depth.
- Callbacks evaluated synchronously by the interpreter itself re-enter on the
  native Rust call stack rather than the heap-allocated frame stack used by
  ordinary function calls. This includes `map()`, `filter()`,
  `sorted()`/`list.sort(key=...)`, `min()`/`max(key=...)`, recursive
  `__repr__`/`__str__`, and non-plain-function `__init__` values that recurse
  during construction. Native re-entry is capped independently at a lower
  fixed depth than the 1000-frame Python limit, so Monty raises
  `RecursionError` before a native stack overflow would abort the process. See
  `limitations/classes.md`'s `__repr__`/`__str__` entry for the main
  user-visible divergence this causes.

## Time

- The host can set a `max_duration` budget; if exceeded the VM stops on
  the next bytecode boundary with `ResourceError`.
- The budget covers cumulative **execution time**, not wall-clock time:
  the clock runs only while the interpreter executes bytecode, and is
  paused while execution is suspended waiting on the host (external
  function calls, OS callbacks) and between REPL feeds. It accumulates
  across feeds for the life of the session.
- The accumulated time is serialized into dumps/snapshots, so a restored
  session resumes its budget where it left off rather than restarting
  from zero.
- There is no in-sandbox way to observe the budget or remaining time.

## JSON

- `json.loads` rejects input nested deeper than 200 levels with
  `json.JSONDecodeError` (independent of the Python recursion limit).

## After a ResourceError

When a resource limit fires, **no guarantees are made about heap state or
reference counts**. The host should discard the VM rather than try to
recover and continue running code in it.
