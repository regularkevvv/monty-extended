//! Bytecode compiler for transforming AST to bytecode.
//!
//! The compiler traverses the prepared AST (`PreparedNode` and `Expr` types from `expressions.rs`)
//! and emits bytecode instructions using `CodeBuilder`. It handles variable scoping,
//! control flow, and expression evaluation order following Python semantics.
//!
//! Functions are compiled recursively: when a `PreparedFunctionDef` is encountered,
//! its body is compiled to bytecode and a `Function` struct is created. All compiled
//! functions are collected and returned along with the module code.
